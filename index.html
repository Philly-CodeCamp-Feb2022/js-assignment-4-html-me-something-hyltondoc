               <img src = "images/yankee stadium.jpg" class ="center-block">
               I was born and raised in the South Bronx and grew up right by Yankee Stadium. Naturally, I was a die-hard Yankees fan and would actually leave school early to sit in the bleachers and watch the daytime games. 
               I also used to cut school to go to the various museums in New York City. My favorite museum to date is the Museum of Natural History and when I worked there as a researcher, I used to walk the halls during my lunch 
               break and take it all in. Definitely a full circle moment. 
               <span style = "color:red"> Fun Fact: </span> I am also a die-hard Knicks fan and my favorite player growing up was Patrick Ewing.

                  I went to DeWitt Clinton in Bronx, NY and I was the valedictorian of my graduating class that was over 800 students! Dewitt Clinton Clinton's Alumni Association ranks among the largest organizations in the world. 
                  I am a proud Governor! (Yes...our mascot was a politician). I credit my high school guidance counselor with much of the success that I have today. When I started the college application process, he gave me a college guide 
                  and told me to pick any school that I wanted to go to and to apply. He made me feel like I could reach the stars and that's exactly what I chose to do in college...literally. 
                  <span style = "color:red"> Fun Fact: </span> I have had the same friends since elementary school into junior high school into high school. Over 15 plus of us are still fiends till this day! Also, thanks to my guidance
                  counselor, I got into all the schools I applied to (even my dream schools!).

                     I went MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts and to say it was a culture shock was an understatement. I majored in Planetary Science (essentially astrophysics) and it was one of the first places that I struggled academically. 
                     I am grateful for my experiences there and I learned a lot about what I am capable of. It was also the place that I had New England Clam Chowder for the first time and I was in love. 
                     <span style = "color:red"> Fun Fact: </span> Don't Stop Believin was the song that played at every bar or nightclub to signify the end of the night and last call. I fondly remember singing Journey at the top
                     of my lungs with friends who became like family and it is still one of my favorite songs till this day!

                        Not much to say here as this was definitely one of my least favorite time periods. The Phd process is everything they say it is and more. However, like my time at MIT I learned so much! The highlight that time was
                        definitely former President Barack Obama speaking at my commencement ceremony! 
                        <span style = "color:red"> Fun Fact: </span> My Phd is in Exposure Science (essentially the field between Environmental Science and Toxicology, drawing heavily from each) and my advisor/program worked on the aftermath
                        and subsequent health outcomes of the 9/11 debris.

                           For some reason, I had always wanted to live in California. This New York at heart girl wanted to have sunshine and beaches year round! So when I graduated from grad school I packed my bags and made the leap! I lived in
                           Los Angeles and Montecito and while I loved the weather, I missed the "pulse" of New York! The pandemic helped me realize that home was where my family and friends where so after 6 years, I came back home. Well...to 
                           New Jersey at least. Close enough.
                           <span style = "color:red"> Fun Fact: </span> I moved to the Montecito area one day before the start of the Thomas Fires and into the Montecito Mudslides. It was definitely a scary time where I learned a lot on
                           the job. Also, when I lived in Montecito I lived in a tiny little guess house that was close to the properties of Oprah and Ellen. I never met them, unfortunately.

                             I couldn't have imagined that my trajectory would have led me to the LaunchCode Bootcamp, but I am so happy that it did.  I can't wait to see what the future holds! 
                              <span style = "color:red"> Fun Fact: </span> The first time I "coded" was at MIT. I learned some logical thinking and data analysis in my major. I also learned basic Scratch and all of the computers 
                              used Unix. Unfortunately, that was also the last time I "coded" as well. So it's been a really long time!
